## Features

EagleEye provides a holistic suite of tools for inventory optimization:

### 1. Demand Forecasting
ML-powered predictions for daily, weekly, and monthly demand using advanced models (XGBoost/Prophet).
> ![Demand Forecasting Dashboard Screenshot](docs/screenshots/demand_forecast.png)
> *Dashboard showing predicted demand vs actual sales with confidence intervals.*

### 2. Intelligent Inventory Management
Automated reorder point calculations and safety stock recommendations based on variability and lead times.
> ![Inventory Management Screenshot](docs/screenshots/inventory_list.png)
> *Real-time inventory tracking with status indicators (Healthy, Critical, Understocked).*

### 3. Demand Analysis
Identify your highest-performing items ("Stars") and underperformers to optimize your catalog.
> ![Demand Analysis Screenshot](docs/screenshots/demand_analysis.png)
> *Top performing items analysis ranked by revenue and order volume.*

### 4. Per-Item Demand Analysis
Deep-dive into specific items with historical sales data, detailed forecasts, and ingredients breakdown (Bill of Materials).
> ![Item Details Screenshot](docs/screenshots/item_details.png)
> *Detailed view of a single item's performance, forecast, and composition.*

### 5. Smart Alerts System
Instant notifications for high-priority issues such as stock checkouts, high demand variability, or expiration risks.
> ![Alerts System Screenshot](docs/screenshots/alerts.png)
> *Priority alerts for immediate action.*

### 6. Dynamic Pricing Engine
Automated discount recommendations for overstocked items, calculated based on utilization rates and predicted demand to maximize revenue while clearing inventory.
> ![Pricing System Screenshot](docs/screenshots/pricing.png)
> *AI-driven discount optimization.*

### 7. Insightful Analytics
Comprehensive dashboards tracking revenue, order volume, and model accuracy metrics (MAPE).
> ![Analytics Dashboard Screenshot](docs/screenshots/dashboard_overview.png)
> *High-level KPIs and business health metrics.*
